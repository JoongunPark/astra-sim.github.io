## Description
As Artificial Intelligence (AI) models are scaling at an unprecedented rate, Machine Learning (ML) execution heavily relies on Distributed ML over customized neural accelerator (e.g., GPU or TPU)-based High-Performance Computing (HPC) platforms connected via high-speed interconnects (e.g., NVLinks). Examples today include NVIDIA's HGX, Google's Cloud TPU, and Meta's Research Supercluster. Distributed Deep Neural Network (DNN) execution involves a complex interplay between the DNN model architecture, parallelization strategy, scheduling strategy, collective communication algorithm, network topology, remote memory accesses, and the accelerator endpoint.

Collective communications (e.g., All-Reduce, Reduce-Scatter, All-Gather, All-to-All) are initiated at different phases for different parallelism approaches and play a crucial role in overall runtime if not hidden efficiently behind computation. This problem becomes paramount as recent Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-3, and Recommendation models, such as DLRM, have billions to trillions of parameters and need to be scaled across tens of thousands of accelerator nodes. As innovation in AI/ML models continues to grow at an accelerated rate, there is a need for a comprehensive methodology to understand and navigate this complex intertwined co-design space to (i) architect future platforms, (ii) develop novel parallelism schemes to support efficient training of future DNN models, and (iii) develop novel fabrics for AI systems.

As an ongoing collaboration between Georgia Tech and several companies (Intel, Meta, AMD, NVIDIA, and HPE), we have been jointly developing a detailed cycle-accurate distributed AI simulator called ASTRA-sim. ASTRA-sim models the co- design space of distributed ML described above and schedules the compute-communication interactions over plug-and-play computation, network, and remote memory simulators. It enables a systematic study of bottleneck detection and futuristic system evaluation at the software and hardware levels for scaling distributed ML. ASTRA-sim leverages the MLCommons Chakra format to describe arbitrary distributed ML workloads. It uses a Google TPU-like simulator as its computation model and provides a suite of network models (analytical network, Garnet, and ns-3) for the choice of simulation speed and fidelity.<br>

### Target Audience
Any researcher with the interest in full-stack, large-scale AI/ML simulation.
